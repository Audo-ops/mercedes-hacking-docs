# A Guide to Hacking and Exploring Your Mercedes-Benz
This repository is a journey on how one would go about hacking and reverse engineering Mercedes vehicles. When we use the term hacking, we pay homage to the original hackers of the day, the [MITâ€™s Tech Model Railroad Club](http://catb.org/esr/writings/hacker-history/hacker-history-3.html) who way back in 1961 hacked their high-tech train sets in order to modify their functions. It is not criminal in any way but is about exploring our cars and understanding how they work and more importantly, how we can modify functions to our liking. 

It will be a living document that is continually edited and updated. This is a new area of car research that takes into account both the mechanical and engineering from yesteryear but also embedded electronics, networking and protocols.
